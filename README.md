Original Author: KeagenT
A fun Java implementation of Triple Triad.
This was in exercise in OOP Programming and Design
as well as custom data structures.
I hope you learn something useful from it!

## Compiling and running Triple Triad
The current implementation requires manual compilation to run.
This requires the JDK version of Java 8+ in order to use the javac command.

* After cloning this repo navigate to the cloned directory using your CLI
* Compile all the .java files using the "javac *.java" command
* Run the class file containing the main method with "java TripleTriadController"

## How to play
This version of triple triad uses the default and open rules.

A triple triad card is a unique 4 sided card with Values ranging from 1 to A 
being the weakest and strongest respectively. The goal of the game is to "capture"
your opponent's cards by placing a higher value side adjacent to an opponent's placed card.
The person with the most amount of captured cards when the 9 slot board is full wins the game.
